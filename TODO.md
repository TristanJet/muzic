## TO 1.0 !!!!!!!!!!
Let's freaking go

- [x] remove queue render flashing
- [x] g, G 
    - [x] variable buffer handling
    - [x] parse int to current pos is u8 !
- [x] ctrl d and u work again
- [x] jump to currently playing
    - [x] make queue adding, deleting work again
        - [x] investigate cause
        - [x] Queue breaks after adding song in the middle
- [x] initial queue position should be currently playing
- [x] n/plen indicator on queue
- [x] crash when I search lotus juice
- [x] BUG: time bar doesn't update on space add if paused
- [x] BACKSPACE for search algo - save the strings?
    - [x] buggy af
- [x] n after search to find next best match
- [x] browser column 1 resets when progress node
- [ ] delete and put and yank in queue
- [ ] moving around in queue, visual mode?
    - [ ] when delete from q, store the song ids
- [ ] Queue buffer adapts to window size
- [ ] next strings in browser should be on press - somehow load next strings for browser
    - [ ] naive get on press

## Semi important
- [ ] allow browse by files and directories - (no tags set)
- [ ] I don't want to touch browser code anymore, needs a full rewrite
- [ ] reset resets final
- [ ] should I unify the caches?
- [ ] return exact matches, this can be done inside the smithwaterman function
- [ ] convert all apostrophes to same, this can be done inside the smithwaterman function
- [ ] implement strict max string size at MPD level
- [ ] ROBUST NONBLOCK flag handling for mac
- [ ] set max size for memory
- [ ] fallback if TTY mode
- [ ] ROBUST check for terminal features - support ASCII
    - [ ] terminfo
    - [ ] return to original state, whatever was printed before running goes back to being visible
- [ ] Kitty input protocol?
- [ ] handle no mp3 tags?

## Bugs/fixes
- [ ] better error handling, I should only run the search algorithms IF there is a valid search set right, so its not the responsibility of algorithm to return error over that
- [ ] flashing in queue
- [ ] check reading terminal input, why do I read one byte at a time??
- [ ] render highlight granular on typing find
- [ ] escape codes stop working after quit - enter
- [ ] fix half up
- [ ] deliberate integer size choice
- [ ] More robust input debounce; I suspect, library size has an effect on mpd response speed.
- [ ] Input mode scope variables
- [ ] get rid of ALL UNNECESSARY public variables
- [ ] algorithm tweak, prioritize matches at the start of the string, for best match functions e.g. Tyler, The Creator
- [ ] display full album content, regardless of artist
- [ ] carefully track persistentallocator use
- [ ] Batch HOLD events on release - seeking, skipping through songs
- [ ] store only visible strings in queue
- [ ] unset apex problem on col switch l 768 in input

- [x] do I need to have two edge iterators???
- [x] BUG: Crash on input if queue empty
- [x] BUG: scroll continues if queue less than window
- [x] adding song to queue seems to fuck up the scroll
- [x] CRASHING BUG: typing in higher column should have same effect as scroll, resetting later nodes
- [x] nasty bug where size is not correctly handled in 3rd column
- [x] FIX/ rewrite window spacing
    - [x] columns walls in browser
- [x] fix search
    - [x] browser search
    - [x] capitalisation in browser search
    - [x] rewrite algorithm - no longer uses allocator
- [x] add a EMPTY QUEUE screen
- [x] print error message if fails to connect to MPD
- [x] invalid argument error message
- [x] parse address before mpd
- [x] render highlight granular on typing find
- [x] g, and G rendereffect only
- [x] utf handling
    - [x] fitting bytes function
    - [x] fitting the text
    - [x] highlight correctly browser
    - [x] data structure implementation
- [x] unset apex error on col switch [PATCHED]
- [x] migrate to zig 0.14
- [x] state save when return to first node
- [x] flashing could be due to unexpected flush - add empty character after content
    - A rendering layer could be added that keeps track of the lengths of the displaying to only clear what is needed.
- [x] outofbounds error in browser
- [x] next_col_ready reimplement
- [x] I think search strings has to be fixed
- [x] MEMORY LEAK suspected at 717 - input.zig
- [x] cursor on third column needs to reset
- [x] columns should be stored in an array, the same way nodes are, duh
- [x] cursor reset -- render function and save apex
- [x] scrolling horizontally works???? sometimes a bug but I can't reproduce
- [x] rewrite Browser - Describe in terms of prev, current, next
- [x] MAC BLOCK TERMINAL WRITES
- [x] key release event
- [x] get the uris for all_songs
- [x] handle column state based on type
- [x] alphabetical order all_songs
- [x] algorithm rewrite, take ITEMS as argument
- [x] NoSongs error, the find object probably being mishandled
- [x] don't let switch column before correct song item displaying
- [x] weird bug where highlight didn't update on normal queue
- [x] removing bugs on delete
- [x] hold x from the top breaks
- [x] queue max_len could be runtime derived from column size in render
- [x] pause flickers the bar and timestamp
- [x] input debounce less
- [x] NUMBER FIX - program will crash if queue longer than 256
## Features 

- [ ] infinite play without filling queue?

- [x] remove indefinite dynamic allocation in queue (memory leak)
    - [x] circular buffer
    - [x] bring out the increment of the ring
